Add a bunch of new hairstyles to Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. There are 7 styles that have 7 colour variations. 3 other styles were created as well, but they have no variation.

From top to bottom: Puffs/buns, beaded hair, princess braid, medium/long hair bun, cute curls, a "modern" cut (whatever that means), and a long punk cut. The three off to the side are references. Twintails, super princess and detective.

### How do I add these?
At the top of the page, you should see click "<> Code". Click that and do "Download Zip". Extract this on your PC, then copy the main mod file "maws_salon" to  
**[Cataclysm Install Directory]\data\mods**

Once the mod is in that folder, it must be activated at world creation or added manually from a world save file.

The mod(s) must then be activated from the World Generation menu.

### Wait- how do I add it to an existing world?
From your CDDA directory, go to "save" (it may be under userdata/save) and open the world file you want to add this mod to. Once you're in the directory, you should see the world's "mods" file. Open that and add "maw_salon" to the last line.

### How do I use this?
Hairs are mutations/traits. Weird. Typically, you change it in character creation. However, if you're like me and can't decide on a style, you can use debug mutations, too. 

### Disclaimer/Notes
This file is released Public Domain as-is. I make no guarantee of current or future function, development, or support.  
You can modify this however you want. I don't really care. Ideally, you would credit me. But this isn't exactly my best work by any means. I mean, it's not like I can go around making sure that everyone credits me.

This mod was made with the intent of adding more unique and diverse hairstyles in the game. I'm not sure if I really succeeded. I did have certain styles and textures in mind when I went in. However, the small scale made this much more of a challenge than I originally anticipated. Thus, I personally see this as a partial failure on my part.
